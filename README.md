# Evaluation-of-SISO-OFDM-and-MIMO-OFDM-Channel-s-Performance-using-Experiment-Set-Up-and-Simulation
This research has proposed to evaluate a Single Input Single Output (SISO) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) capability using experiment set up as well as apply adaptive modulation techniques and MIMO-OFDM in a simulation experiment to mitigate interference-effect.
